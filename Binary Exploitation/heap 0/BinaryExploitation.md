# Binary Exploitation

## What Is Binary Exploitation?

Binary exploitation is the process of leveraging vulnerabilities in compiled programs (binaries) to gain unintended access, execute arbitrary code, or alter a program’s behavior. It often involves understanding low-level program logic and memory management.

## Common Vulnerabilities

- **Buffer Overflows**: Writing beyond the bounds of a buffer, potentially overwriting return addresses or control data.
- **Format String Vulnerabilities**: Unsanitized format string input (e.g., `printf(user_input)`) that can leak memory or write arbitrary data.
- **Use-After-Free**: Using memory after it has been deallocated, which can lead to unexpected behavior or code execution.
- **Heap Exploits**: Manipulating memory management systems to execute arbitrary code or gain control of a program.
- **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)**: Crafting fake call stacks to redirect control flow without injecting new code (bypassing NX protections).

## Common Tools

- `gdb` / `pwndbg`: Debuggers used to analyze binary execution.
- `objdump`, `readelf`: Tools to inspect ELF binaries.
- `pwntools`: Python library to interact with binary processes, useful in CTF challenges.
- `gef`: GDB extension with exploit dev features.

## Goals of Binary Exploitation

- Gain shell access (remote or local)
- Escalate privileges
- Read restricted files (e.g., `flag.txt` in CTFs)
- Subvert logic (e.g., bypass authentication)
