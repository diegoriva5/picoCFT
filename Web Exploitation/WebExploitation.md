# Web Exploitation

## What Is Web Exploitation?

Web exploitation involves discovering and leveraging vulnerabilities in web applications to gain unauthorized access, bypass restrictions, or extract sensitive data. It's one of the most common categories in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and real-world penetration testing.

## Common Web Vulnerabilities

- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**  
  Injecting SQL queries to read or manipulate databases.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
  Injecting malicious JavaScript to run in the browser of other users.

- **Command Injection**  
  Injecting system commands into a vulnerable application to execute on the server.

- **File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)**  
  Exploiting how files are loaded or included to read server files or execute remote code.

- **Broken Authentication**  
  Abusing flaws in login/session mechanisms to impersonate users.

- **Directory Traversal**  
  Accessing restricted files by manipulating file paths (`../../etc/passwd`).

- **Insecure Deserialization**  
  Manipulating serialized objects to achieve remote code execution or logic manipulation.

## Common Tools

- `Burp Suite`: Intercepts and manipulates HTTP requests/responses.
- `Postman`: For testing APIs.
- Browser DevTools: Essential for inspecting and manipulating front-end code.
- `sqlmap`: Automated SQL injection tool.
- `wfuzz`, `ffuf`: Fuzzing tools for discovering hidden endpoints and parameters.
- `curl`: Command-line tool to test endpoints.

## Useful Techniques

- Parameter tampering
- Cookie/session manipulation
- Bypassing client-side validation
- Fuzzing inputs and endpoints
- Analyzing JavaScript for hidden clues or logic

---

## CTF Focus

In CTFs, Web Exploitation often involves:

- Finding hidden parameters or endpoints
- Analyzing source code or frontend behavior
- Bypassing login pages or uploading malicious files
- Stealing or forging cookies

## Tips

- Always inspect the source code (View Source / DevTools)
- Look at cookies, headers, and hidden fields
- Test for common bypass tricks (e.g., `admin'--`, `../`, double encoding)
